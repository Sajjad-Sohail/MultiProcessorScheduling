MULTI-PROCESSOR SCHEDULER


This project is about designing and simulating a clock-driven quad-processor scheduler in an object-oriented manner. The scheduler consists of a multi-level job queue where each level follows a different scheduling algorithm viz. Priority, Shortest Job First (SJF) and First-come-first-serve (FCFS). These queues will be enqueued with PCBs. The PCBs can further be classified into Recurring and non-Recurring. These PCBs are generated randomly, based on the probability data provided in an input file.

To run the project:
1) Download Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and add the solution 
2) Input/output file for processing
